# Pulse — Domain Context

Pulse is a real-time livestream platform built primarily as a learning project for Kafka and distributed-systems architecture. The product is a Twitch-style experience: creators stream, viewers watch and chat, and the platform reacts to a continuous flow of events around each stream.

## Glossary

### Media Plane

The path that carries the actual video and audio bytes from a creator's encoder to viewers' players. Built on standard streaming protocols (RTMP/WebRTC in, HLS/DASH/LL-HLS out) and a media server. **Kafka is not part of the media plane.** Frame data does not flow through Kafka.

### Control Plane

Everything _around_ the stream: account lifecycle, follows, chat, emotes, notifications, analytics, recommendations, moderation. The control plane is event-driven and Kafka is its backbone. The control plane _observes_ the media plane through lifecycle events (e.g. `StreamStarted`, `StreamEnded`, `ViewerJoined`) but does not transport media.

### Stream

A single live broadcast session by a creator. Has a lifecycle: scheduled → live → ended. Stream lifecycle transitions are first-class control-plane events.

### Channel

The creator's persistent identity that owns streams over time. A channel exists between streams; a stream is a single instance.

### Slug

A channel's stable, human-readable public address (e.g. `alices-channel`) — unique, owned by `identity`. The `channelId` (a uuid) is the internal identity used for partitioning and joins; the slug is what a viewer's URL carries. The two are distinct: viewers connect to `/ws/{slug}`, but every event is keyed by `channelId`. Because `chat` must map one to the other without querying `identity`, the slug travels **inside** the stream-lifecycle events (see Chat topology). _Avoid:_ using the slug as a partition key or treating it as mutable identity.

### Viewer

An account in its stream-watching role — _not_ a distinct entity. The same `userId` identifies a person whether they are watching, chatting, or following; there is no separate viewer identity and no anonymous viewing (an account is required to watch). _Avoid:_ a separate `viewerId`, "viewer account."

Viewer is the _identity_ (who is watching). The _unit of presence_ — what "concurrent viewers" counts — is the **Viewer session**, not the account.

### Viewer session

A single live WebSocket connection from a viewer to `chat`. It is the unit of presence: `ViewerJoined` is emitted when a session opens and passes the liveness gate, `ViewerLeft` when it closes (for any reason), and "concurrent viewers" is the count of currently-open sessions — which `analytics` approximates via windowing. One account may hold several simultaneous sessions (e.g. two browser tabs), and each counts; presence is session-grained, not account-grained. (In the MVP the `userId` is hardcoded, so every session shares one account — the count still reflects sessions, which is the point.) _Avoid:_ deduplicating presence by `userId`, or treating "viewer count" as "distinct accounts watching."

## Bounded contexts (services)

Pulse starts as three services, deliberately polyglot to force real contracts across the wire.

### `identity` — TypeScript / Bun

Owns accounts, channels, and the follow graph. The user-facing API. Produces lifecycle events: `AccountCreated`, `ChannelCreated`, `FollowAdded`, `FollowRemoved`, `StreamScheduled`, `StreamStarted`, `StreamEnded`.

### `chat` — Go

WebSocket gateway and chat ingestion. Handles thousands of concurrent viewer connections per node. Produces `ChatMessageSent`, `EmoteReacted`, `ViewerJoined`, `ViewerLeft`. Consumes channel/stream state from `identity` to validate who can chat where.

This liveness gate is **eventually consistent**: `chat` learns a channel is live by consuming `stream.started.v1` / `stream.ended.v1`, so it lags `identity` by its own consumer lag. Two windows follow and are accepted deliberately (the alternative — a synchronous check against `identity` — is the coupling we're avoiding): a viewer who connects between `StreamStarted` and `chat` consuming it is rejected (close `1008`) though the channel is genuinely live; a message sent on a still-open socket between `StreamEnded` and its consumption is produced against an already-ended `streamId`. Both are self-healing (the client retries the upgrade). On `StreamEnded`, `chat` force-closes the channel's open connections with close code `1001` ("going away").

### `analytics` — Kotlin + Kafka Streams

Pure stream-processing service. Consumes events from `identity` and `chat`; produces windowed aggregates (concurrent viewers, chat rate, top streams) as compacted topics that the dashboard reads from. No external API surface beyond a query layer over its state stores.

## Source-of-truth model

Pulse is deliberately hybrid: each bounded context picks the SoT model that fits its data shape.

- **`identity`** — Postgres is canonical. Events flow out via the **transactional outbox** pattern; the log is a notification stream, not the truth. The relay is an in-process polling loop ([ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-in-process-polling-outbox-relay.md)); CDC is deferred to Phase 3.
- **`chat`** — Kafka _is_ the source of truth. Messages are an append-only log; redactions are additive events on a compacted side topic. Reads are served from projections (Redis ring buffer for mid-stream join; S3 chat-replay archives for VOD).
- **`analytics`** — No original state. State stores (RocksDB under Kafka Streams) are materialised views over upstream topics; loss is recovered by replay.

## Chat topology

| Topic                     | Key         | Retention | Compacted | Purpose                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `chat.messages.v1`        | `channelId` | 7 days    | No        | Canonical message log                |
| `chat.redactions.v1`      | `messageId` | Forever   | Yes       | Moderation overrides, joined at read |
| `chat.presence.joined.v1` | `channelId` | 1 day     | No        | Viewer-session open events           |
| `chat.presence.left.v1`   | `channelId` | 1 day     | No        | Viewer-session close events          |

Presence is **split into two topics**, not one `chat.presence.v1` carrying both — one event type per topic, per [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-schema-strategy.md). The alternative (a single `chat.presence.v1` with a `ViewerPresenceChanged { kind }` envelope) would give per-channel total ordering of join/leave, but presence is consumed by `analytics` as a windowed, approximate concurrent-viewer count, so single-partition ordering buys nothing worth a `TopicNameStrategy` exception.

**Projections off the chat log:**

- **Redis** — per-channel last-N ring buffer for mid-stream-join UX
- **S3 / MinIO** — per-stream chat archives written by an archiver consumer on `StreamEnded`

## Schemas & contracts

- **Format:** Avro. Chosen because Schema Registry is itself part of the lesson and Avro is its native format; the reader/writer schema resolution model is a core distributed-systems idea worth experiencing firsthand.
- **Registry:** Apicurio Registry (Apache-2.0 licensed, Confluent-compatible protocol), run locally in Docker.
- **Source of schemas:** monorepo, in `packages/schemas/`. Each service runs Avro codegen from the shared `.avsc` files at build time. The registry _enforces_ compatibility (CI publishes and rejects on break); the `.avsc` files in the repo are the human-readable SoT.
- **Compatibility mode:** `BACKWARD` — producers can add optional fields with defaults; consumers can upgrade later.
- **Subject naming:** `TopicNameStrategy` — one event type per topic. Forces each event's lifecycle (retention, partitioning, consumers) to be designed independently.
- **Event → topic mapping** is owned by the `EVENT_TOPICS` map in `packages/schemas/topics.ts` — the single executable source of truth shared by producers, consumers, the registry publisher (`scripts/publish.ts`), and the topic provisioner (`scripts/provision-topics.ts`). Its sibling `TOPIC_CONFIGS` holds each topic's partition count and retention, which provisioning reads. This document records only _domain_ decisions about a topic (keying, retention, compaction, and the rationale), never the bare mapping, which would inevitably drift.

**Stream lifecycle topics:** `StreamStarted` and `StreamEnded` are two separate topics (`stream.started.v1`, `stream.ended.v1`), produced by `identity`.

| Topic               | Key         | Retention | Compacted | Purpose              |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| `stream.started.v1` | `channelId` | 7 days    | No        | Channel went live    |
| `stream.ended.v1`   | `channelId` | 7 days    | No        | Channel stream ended |

Both are **keyed by `channelId`**, deliberately co-partitioned with the chat topics so a channel's stream-state and its chat land on the same partition — the precondition for joining stream-state against the chat stream in `analytics` without a repartition. Retention is 7-day **delete, not compacted**: these are immutable lifecycle _facts_, not a current-state snapshot, and Postgres holds the canonical `streams` history, so the log needs no permanent record for state reconstruction. Keying, retention, and the system-wide partition count are recorded in [ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-stream-lifecycle-topic-topology.md).

Both events also carry the channel's **`channelSlug`** in their payload. `chat` accepts viewer connections by slug but tracks liveness and produces by `channelId`; carrying the slug in the lifecycle event lets `chat` build its `slug → channelId` mapping purely from the log, with no synchronous call back to `identity`. The slug is denormalized channel reference data riding along with the lifecycle fact — the consumer's needs, not the producer's, shape the payload.

## Repo layout

Monorepo. Operational cost of 3 separate repos for 3 services outweighs the boundary benefits.
